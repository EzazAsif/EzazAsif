## üåü Featured Projects

### üì≤ [Messaging App with End-to-End Encryption and Inbuilt Spam Detection](https://github.com/EzazAsif/Messaging-App-with-End-to-End-Encryption-and-Inbuilt-spam-detection)
A secure, privacy-first messaging app that utilizes RSA encryption and a custom-trained spam filter model to keep conversations safe and clutter-free. Key features include:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using RSA, ensuring secure communication.
- **Spam Detection**: An inbuilt spam filter trained on common spam patterns, allowing messages to remain spam-free.
- **Media Support**: Send text and multimedia files with ease.
- **Google Authentication**: Secure and quick sign-in for users.
  
### üé• Movie Recommendation System
An intelligent movie recommender that suggests titles based on your tastes in **genres, star cast, directors, and IMDb ratings**. The model evaluates a mix of user preferences, allowing users to:
- Browse personalized movie suggestions.
- Score movies based on parameters like genre and cast.
- Discover new titles based on past viewing patterns.

### üóìÔ∏è Calendar Application with MySQL Integration
A robust calendar app for organizing events, meetings, and tasks. Built to connect seamlessly with a MySQL database, it supports efficient **event scheduling and retrieval**. This project showcases my skills in database handling and front-end interfacing for smooth user interaction.

### üì∏ Facial Recognition and Clustering Project
Using deep learning for facial recognition, this project identifies and organizes people in group photos:
- **Face Clustering**: Clusters faces into folders based on individual identity.
- **VGGFace2 Dataset**: The model leverages the VGGFace2 dataset for face recognition.
- **Efficient Organization**: Automatically sorts images for easy retrieval.
